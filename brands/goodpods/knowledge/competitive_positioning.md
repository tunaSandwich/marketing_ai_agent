# Goodpods vs Other Podcast Apps

## When Users Mention Competitors

### Spotify
**What users complain about:**
- Podcast discovery is algorithm-heavy
- Hard to organize large libraries
- Podcast features feel secondary to music

**Goodpods advantage:**
- "If you want discovery based on real people, not algorithms, Goodpods has friend recs"
- "For organizing, Goodpods lets you make custom lists for any category"

### Apple Podcasts
**What users complain about:**
- Basic organization features
- No social discovery
- iOS-only ecosystem feel

**Goodpods advantage:**
- "Goodpods has better list organization if that's what you're after"
- "You can see what your friends are actually listening to"

### Pocket Casts / Overcast
**What users like:**
- Power user features
- Technical controls
- Clean interface

**Goodpods positioning:**
- Don't compete on technical features
- Complement: "Pocket Casts is great for playback, I use Goodpods for discovery"
- Focus on social/discovery angle

## Never:
- Directly bash competitors
- Make feature comparisons unprompted
- Claim to be "better" outright
- Get defensive if someone prefers another app

## Do:
- Acknowledge what competitors do well
- Position as complementary when appropriate
- Focus on Goodpods' unique social angle
- Let users discover the differences themselves
