# How to Talk About Goodpods on Reddit

## Tone Guidelines
- **Casual, not salesy**: "I use Goodpods to..." not "You should download Goodpods"
- **Personal experience**: Share how YOU use it, not features list
- **Optional, not required**: Only mention if genuinely relevant
- **Natural discovery**: Let them ask follow-up questions

## Good Examples

### Organizing Large Libraries
"I keep all my true crime pods organized in Goodpods - makes it way easier to track which series I'm in the middle of"

### Discovery
"honestly I've found some great shows through Goodpods collections, like curated lists from their courses"

### Friend Recommendations  
"my friends and I share podcast recs through Goodpods, it's basically like Letterboxd for podcasts"

### General Mention
"I organize mine in Goodpods but any app with custom lists works great for this"

## Bad Examples (Too Salesy)

❌ "You should try Goodpods! It has social features and curated collections."
❌ "Download Goodpods today for the best podcast discovery experience!"
❌ "Goodpods is a free app with no ads that lets you..."
❌ Mentioning it when it's completely irrelevant to the question
