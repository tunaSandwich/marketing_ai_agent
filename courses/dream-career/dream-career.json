    "description": "Your career doesn't have to follow a straight line. This course brings together some of the world's most accomplished founders, professors, and executives who have successfully reinvented their careers—from Tim Ferriss (4x NYT bestselling author) discussing life design and risk-taking, to Ben Horowitz (co-founder of a16z) on transitioning from founder to legendary venture capitalist, to Professor Herminia Ibarra (leading academic expert on career transitions) sharing decades of research on professional reinvention. You'll learn from those who've lived it and those who've studied it.\n\nThe course is designed as a progressive journey. In the Beginner level, you'll build the foundational mindset for change through conversations with thought leaders like Tim Ferriss on Armchair Expert, career coach John Tarnoff (author of 'Boomer Reinvention'), and FIFA Player of the Year Carli Lloyd on what purpose-driven work actually looks and feels like. You'll also hear from Harvard Professor Monica Higgins on breaking into new fields and a U.S. military veteran who transitioned to clinical counseling and entrepreneurship—showing that reinvention is possible from any starting point.\n\nThe Intermediate level gets tactical with Adam Grant (Wharton professor and organizational psychologist) on WorkLife, exploring research-backed strategies for navigating career turbulence. You'll learn from corporate executives who became entrepreneurs, technical founders who left consulting to build (and sell) companies, and career transformation experts who coach professionals through these exact transitions. These episodes provide the frameworks, strategies, and real-world lessons you need to execute your pivot successfully.\n\nThe Advanced level features the ultimate career architects: Hubert Joly (former Best Buy CEO, now Harvard Business School lecturer) on purpose-driven transformation, Ilana Golan (tech executive turned founder) on building portfolio careers with multiple income streams, Lex Fridman (MIT researcher and top podcast host) on what permits true freedom in work and life, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder) on the counterintuitive principles that help you design your life masterfully. These are the people who have reached the pinnacle of success and then intentionally reinvented themselves—multiple times. This course isn't about motivational platitudes; it's about learning from people with real credentials, proven track records, and hard-won wisdom about making career reinvention work in the real world.",
