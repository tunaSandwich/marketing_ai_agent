================================================================================
⭐ ACCEPTABLE - USE ONLY IF NEEDED
================================================================================

[Would include episodes that have some merit but weaker credentials or less clear expertise signals]

================================================================================
❌ REJECT - NEVER USE
================================================================================

EPISODE: All Joe Rogan episodes with guests
REASON: Per CLAUDE.md instructions: "❌ Joe Rogan or any other bullshit podcast"

EPISODE: Most "How I Built This" search results
REASON: Results were mostly ABOUT the podcast itself, not actual founder interviews. Would need to search for specific founder episodes.

EPISODE: Generic "Tim Ferriss" episodes without guest
REASON: Description shows "Lex Fridman is an AI researcher at MIT and host of the Lex Fridman Podcast" - these are cross-promotional episodes, not substantive interviews. Just listing credentials without content.

EPISODE: Quote/snippet podcasts
REASON: Many results were just quote compilations or brief mentions, not full substantive interviews.

EPISODE: Podcast episodes about themselves
REASON: Many search results returned episodes describing the podcast rather than interview episodes.

EPISODE: Episodes without identifiable expert guest
REASON: Any episode where description doesn't clearly identify who the expert guest is and their credentials.

EPISODE: Spiritual/mystical creativity content
REASON: Per CLAUDE.md, avoid "Spiritual/mystical interpretations" of creative/scientific topics.

EPISODE: Wikipedia-based content
REASON: Per CLAUDE.md red flags, avoid episodes that mention Wikipedia as source.

EPISODE: Host monologues ("I explain...")
REASON: Must be interview format with identifiable expert, not solo host explaining topics.
