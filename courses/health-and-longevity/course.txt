## NOTES

**Podcast Diversity Achieved**: 18 different podcasts
**Expert Diversity**: MDs and PhDs from Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, USC, Salk Institute, Mayo Clinic, and more
**Topic Coverage**: Complete coverage of all plan areas - nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress, aging biology, preventive medicine, cellular mechanisms, cutting-edge interventions

**Need to complete**:
- Episodes 10 and 11 need specific episode IDs (cardiovascular and brain health)
- All other 16 episodes are fully documented and ready

**Next step**: Create JSON file with all episode IDs and course metadata
