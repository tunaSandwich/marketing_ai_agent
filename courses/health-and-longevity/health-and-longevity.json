    "description": "Learn how to optimize your healthspan—not just how long you live, but how well you live—through conversations with the world's leading longevity researchers and physicians. This course brings together experts from Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, USC, Mayo Clinic, and the Salk Institute who are pushing the boundaries of aging science and translating cutting-edge research into actionable strategies you can implement today.\n\nBeginning with accessible foundations, you'll learn from Peter Attia (Stanford/Johns Hopkins-trained longevity physician) about healthspan vs lifespan and the \"four horsemen\" of disease. David Sinclair (Harvard professor of genetics) explains why aging itself is a treatable condition. Matthew Walker (UC Berkeley sleep scientist) reveals why sleep is the most powerful longevity intervention. You'll discover practical interventions from Rhonda Patrick (PhD biomedical science), learn about fasting from Valter Longo (USC Longevity Institute director), and understand circadian rhythms from Satchin Panda (Salk Institute professor).\n\nThe intermediate level builds mechanistic understanding: exercise science deep-dives with Andy Galpin (PhD human bioenergetics), VO2 max physiology with Mayo Clinic's Mike Joyner, cardiovascular health with Emory cardiologist Gina Lundberg, brain health and neuroplasticity with Austin Perlmutter, and advanced circadian biology. You'll understand how sleep, exercise, and nutrition interact systemically to promote longevity.\n\nFinally, you'll explore the molecular frontiers of aging research: sirtuins and NAD+ pathways with David Sinclair, cellular senescence and senolytics with leading researchers Marco Demaria and Peter Adams, epigenetic reprogramming and aging reversal experiments, advanced VO2 max optimization, and the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and fasting-induced cellular renewal. By the end, you'll understand both the practical lifestyle pillars of longevity and the cutting-edge cellular biology that researchers are targeting to extend healthy human lifespan.",
