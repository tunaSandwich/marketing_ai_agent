## REJECTED EPISODES (Examples of what NOT to use)

### ❌ REJECT
**ID**: 62871713
**Title**: "'Huberman Lab'"
**Podcast**: "Podcast Reviews"
**Reason**: This is people DISCUSSING Huberman Lab, not the actual Huberman Lab podcast. No direct expert.

### ❌ REJECT
**ID**: 47329802
**Title**: "#240 - ANDREW HUBERMAN 'EXPOSED': The Side Hoes Of Huberman Lab"
**Reason**: Gossip/commentary about Huberman, not scientific content.

### ❌ REJECT
Multiple episodes with titles like "My Thoughts On..." or "I Explain..."
**Reason**: Solo host monologues without expert guests.

### ❌ REJECT
Episodes from podcasts like "Two Dudes Podcast" or amateur-sounding shows
**Reason**: No clear credentials, likely casual discussion not expert interview.

---

**Podcast Diversity Requirement**: Must use 6 different podcasts per level (18 different podcasts total).

**Current podcast distribution**:
- Huberman Lab: 1 (beginner)
- The Knowledge Project: 1 (beginner)
- CIIS Public Programs: 1 (beginner)
- FoundMyFitness: 1 (beginner) + 1 (intermediate) = 2 total
- Rich Roll Podcast: 1 (beginner)
- Mundie on Monday: 1 (beginner)
- Food We Need To Talk: 1 (intermediate)
- The Peter Attia Drive: 1 (intermediate) + 1 (advanced) = 2 total
