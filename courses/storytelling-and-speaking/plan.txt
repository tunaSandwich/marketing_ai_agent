# Storytelling & Speaking Course Plan
## "From nerves to narrative—how to move a room"

## Course Purpose

This course teaches the art and science of public speaking and storytelling—from overcoming stage fright to crafting narratives that move audiences. Learners will progress from foundational confidence-building techniques to advanced rhetorical mastery, learning from world-class speakers, storytelling coaches, communication professors, TED speakers, and master performers.

The course focuses on both the psychological aspects (managing nerves, building confidence) and the technical craft (narrative structure, vocal delivery, audience connection). Each episode features expert interviews with practitioners who have mastered the art of moving rooms—whether on stage, in boardrooms, or through storytelling platforms.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid for This Topic

1. **Self-help gurus without credentials** - Many "speaking experts" have no formal training or track record
2. **Generic business podcasts** - Superficial "presentation tips" without depth
3. **Spiritual/manifestation focus** - "Speak it into existence" rather than practical technique
4. **Host monologues** - "Here are my 5 tips for public speaking" without expert interview
5. **Casual discussion** - Friends chatting about speaking without expertise
6. **Single-source repetition** - Using the same speaking coach 5 times instead of diverse experts
7. **TED talk worship** - Focus on TED without broader speaking expertise
8. **Missing the fear component** - Beginner level must address anxiety/nerves, not just technique
