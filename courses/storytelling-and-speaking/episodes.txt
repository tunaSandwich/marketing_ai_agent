## ❌ REJECT EPISODES

### Episode ID: Various Lex Fridman episodes
**Reason for Rejection:**
While Lex Fridman is popular, these episodes don't focus specifically on storytelling or speaking skills. They're general interviews.

**Reason for Rejection:**
Most don't specifically cover speaking/storytelling as the main topic. Guest selection would need to be very specific.

**Reason for Rejection:**
Many are just podcast names or generic discussions, not expert interviews on speaking.

### Episode ID: Most "Toastmasters" episodes
**Reason for Rejection:**
Too focused on Toastmasters-specific competition format. While some champions are good, the style is very particular and not universally applicable.

### Episode ID: Various generic "presentation skills" episodes
