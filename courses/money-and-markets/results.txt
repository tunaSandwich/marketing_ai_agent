PODCAST: (ID: 43782)
DESCRIPTION: We live on planet money, so why do we have so much trouble getting some of it? Todays show is being released based on a question from a listener from Join Up Dots Hello there, A good morning to The Join Up Dots team. I have been listening to your shows for nearly 2 years now racking my brains to find a business idea. And everytime I come up with something I think to myself I can't afford this. I can't afford the website but hosting anything to get it off the ground and I seem to be going round and round in circles. Can you suggest any way that I can really bootstrap this so that I can get my idea going? I have spoken to many friends and they say it's a brilliant idea but as I say money is a huge issue and I'm too scared to put debt onto my credit card Thank you so much Jenny Castor, Millhaven, New York As you will hear from the show the quickest way to earn is to use the money we already have wisely. Most of us will simply live hand to mouth, where we use the money when we fancy it instead of making a plan to follow each month. Yeah, I know this sounds boring and the last thing that you want to do when you can be out having fun with your mates, but you only have to do this once. So in todays episode we discuss everything money and discover that we actually live in Planet Money. We just have to stop it floating away from us.

TITLE: Monetary Policy
PODCAST: Two Blokes Trading (ID: 64199)

In the episode, Rory talks about the divergence between interest rates at the ECB and BOE closing in on those from the FED which is starting to support moves higher in both EUR / USD and GBP / USD. Cable has now been able to break above 1.28 for the first time in over a year following the stronger dollar in 2022 and the weakening sterling that was seen under the short-lived Truss era.Rory discusses the topic of "higher interest rates are here to stay". He explains that before the Great Financial Crisis interest rates were not at the crazy lows that many market participants have been used to and perhaps markets are now adjusting for rates to remain higher at 5% for a much longer period into the future.Mike talks about how gold paints a good picture in terms of sentiment, prices have been stable the previous few weeks and are still sitting close to all time highs and currently rangebound between 1940 and 1980. Mike shares his reasoning for why he doesn't think gold is going anytime soon even as he discusses the bearish sentiment on the technical indicators but still thinks the macro environment is supportive to retain these higher prices.Download the Two Blokes Trading APP

Results returned: 10,000+ (showing top 15)

EPISODE ID: 77884350
TITLE: a16z Podcast: Real Estate -- Ownership, Asset, Economy
PODCAST: a16z Podcast (ID: 11879)
DESCRIPTION: The largest asset class in the United States is owner-occupied real estate, yet options for homeowners accessing this are very binary right now: either own 100% of your home (with a mortgage), or own nothing. And when people do "own", that ownership is often skewed by debt. Of course, debt works out great for some, given their risk profiles and potential upside (if the house keeps appreciating); but the downside risk and costs are disproportionately borne by the homeowner. And millennials can't even enter the housing market in the first place. So how can technology help address a system skewed by debt financing, by letting homeowners sell fractions of equity to unlock wealth without necessarily borrowing against their homes? How can such new approaches help homeowners and financers better align risk and incentives, and unlock a whole new asset class for all kinds of investors? How can they help avoid mortgage crises around the world, and the macroeconomic impact of reduced spending, lost jobs, and more? And finally, what is the role of policy here ... especially since the government is de facto subsidizer of certain home finance products over others. We discuss all this and more in this episode of the a16z Podcast, featuring general partner Alex Rampell; CEO & co-founder of Point, Eddie Lim; and Atif Mian, professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University who also co-authored (with Amir Sufi) the book House of Debt: How They (and You) Caused the Great Recession, and How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again — in conversation with deal and investing team partner Angela Strange.

EPISODE ID: 77884388
TITLE: a16z Podcast: An Economics Take on the Sharing Economy
PODCAST: a16z Podcast (ID: 11879)
DESCRIPTION: Love the term or hate it, the concept and reality of the "sharing economy" (or "gig economy" and so on) is here to stay. And in fact, argues NYU Stern professor and researcher Arun Sundararajan, it may even reduce the income distribution gap between the haves and have-nots in a way that previous shifts -- like the Industrial Revolution and traditional 20th century institutions -- never did. How? Because it's a new model for (crowd-based) capitalism -- one where we're increasing the segment of the population that owns the means of production. Or... have we just shifted value from traditional institutions to the platforms instead? Well, let's see what the data tells us. In this episode of the a16z Podcast, Sundararajan (who is also affiliated with NYU's Center for Urban Science+Progress and at NYU's Center for Data Science) shares the latest findings, economics research, and more from his new book on The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism.

DESCRIPTION: This week's episode is an interview with Joseph Doyle. Joe is the Erwin H. Schell Professor of Management and Applied Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management who has had a distinguished career as a labor economist studying a range of topics that most outside of economics do not always associate with the field — like child welfare and foster care, juvenile incarceration and its effect on high school completion and adult incarceration, and more. The welfare of children, as it turns out, has been a longstanding research focus of Dr. Doyle's, and because I've written on foster care myself, and because his paper with Anna Aizer study the causal effect that juvenile incarceration has on high school completion and adult incarceration is one of my favorite applied papers ever written by economists, I have constantly gravitated back to him and his work.
