    "description": "Economics shapes everything—from the price of your morning coffee to the wealth of nations. This course takes you on a comprehensive journey through modern economics, learning directly from Nobel Prize winners, central bank chairs, and leading researchers at the world's top universities. You'll hear from five Nobel laureates, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart, and professors from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton. These aren't generic explainers—these are the economists who've shaped how we understand markets, inequality, trade, and prosperity.\n\nThe course progresses strategically through three levels. Beginners start with economic thinking fundamentals, learning how economists analyze incentives, markets, and trade from experts like Tyler Cowen and Dartmouth's Douglas Irwin. You'll understand inflation through NPR's acclaimed Planet Money, see Nobel laureate Alvin Roth's market design in action, and discover how economic policy actually works from Presidential advisor Jared Bernstein. The intermediate level examines economic systems and power structures through the insights of Nobel winners Angus Deaton on inequality and pioneering researchers like Thomas Piketty and Carmen Reinhart on wealth concentration and financial crises. You'll learn how central banks operate from Janet Yellen herself and explore global economic challenges with Dr. Dambisa Moyo.\n\nThe advanced level takes you to the research frontier. You'll understand how economists determine cause and effect with 2021 Nobel laureate Josh Angrist, explore market power and regulation with 2014 Nobel winner Jean Tirole, and see how experimental methods fight global poverty with 2019 Nobel laureate Esther Duflo (the youngest economist ever to win). MIT's Joseph Doyle shows how economics applies to social policy, while Harvard's Dani Rodrik challenges conventional wisdom on globalization—demonstrating that even fundamental economic principles can be questioned rigorously. By the end, you won't just understand economic topics; you'll think like an economist, evaluate evidence like a researcher, and critically assess policy debates with the tools used by the experts themselves.\n\nThis is economics education at the highest level—authoritative, rigorous, and transformative. Every episode features verified experts with PhDs, endowed professorships, Nobel Prizes, or senior policy roles at institutions like the Federal Reserve, IMF, and World Bank. You're learning from the people who create economic knowledge, advise presidents, and shape global policy. Whether you're trying to understand inflation, inequality, trade wars, or financial crises, these economists will give you the frameworks, evidence, and critical thinking tools to make sense of the economic forces that drive our world.",
