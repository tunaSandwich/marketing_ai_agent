## COURSE STRUCTURE RATIONALE

### Learning Progression Philosophy:

**Beginner Level: Building Blocks**
The beginner level introduces economic thinking and fundamental concepts through accessible episodes featuring top economists explaining basics clearly. Tyler Cowen teaches economic thinking, Planet Money explains inflation, Douglas Irwin introduces trade, Alvin Roth shows market design in action, and Jared Bernstein demonstrates policy implementation. These six episodes build a foundation of economic literacy.

**Intermediate Level: Systems and Institutions**
The intermediate level examines how economic systems actually function, focusing on inequality, financial instability, policy institutions, and global economics. Nobel laureates (Deaton), leading researchers (Piketty, Reinhart), and senior policymakers (Yellen) explain systems-level thinking. Learners understand how economies work as complex systems with winners, losers, and institutional constraints.

**Advanced Level: Research Frontiers and Critical Thinking**
The advanced level introduces cutting-edge research methods and challenges to orthodoxy. Four Nobel Prize winners (Tirole, Angrist, Duflo, Roth in beginner) demonstrate frontier research. Learners understand how economic knowledge is created (methods), applied (to social policy and development), and questioned (Rodrik's challenge to globalization). This level develops economic maturity: understanding the field well enough to evaluate and critique it.

### Expert Diversity Achieved:

**Nobel Prize Winners:** 5 total
- Angus Deaton (2015) - Inequality
- Jean Tirole (2014) - Market Power
- Alvin Roth (2012) - Market Design
- Esther Duflo (2019) - Development
- Joshua Angrist (2021) - Causal Inference

**Institutional Diversity:**
- Universities: MIT (3), Harvard (2), Stanford, Princeton, Dartmouth, George Mason, Paris School of Economics, Colorado Boulder
- Policy Institutions: Federal Reserve, US Treasury, World Bank, IMF, Council of Economic Advisers
- Geographic: US, UK, France, international organizations

**Gender Diversity:**
- Female economists: 4 (Esther Duflo, Carmen Reinhart, Janet Yellen, Dambisa Moyo)
- Male economists: 14
- Represents significant improvement from typical economics representation

**Podcast Diversity:**
All 18 episodes from different podcasts, ensuring maximum diversity of formats, styles, and audiences.

### Topic Coverage:

**Macro Topics:** Inflation, monetary policy, financial crises, economic growth, GDP
**Micro Topics:** Market design, market power, regulation, incentives
**International:** Trade, globalization, development, China-US relations
**Distributional:** Inequality, poverty, social policy, welfare
**Methodological:** Causal inference, experimental methods, empirical economics
**Policy:** Fiscal policy, central banking, government role, regulation
**Contemporary:** Trade wars, post-pandemic recovery, ESG, democracy and economics

### Why This Course is Authoritative:

1. **Credential Quality:** Every episode features economists with PhD, top university positions, Nobel Prizes, or senior policy roles (Fed Chair, World Bank Chief Economist, Presidential advisors)

2. **Interview Format:** All episodes feature expert guests being interviewed (no solo monologues or casual chats)

3. **Source Quality:** Episodes from respected podcasts (EconTalk, Planet Money, The Economist, IMF, World Economic Forum, Nobel Prize podcast, university-affiliated shows)

4. **Research-Based:** Guests discuss actual research, books, and empirical findings—not opinion or speculation

5. **Diverse Perspectives:** While maintaining rigor, includes orthodox and heterodox views (Rodrik challenges mainstream), different countries, and diverse voices

6. **Progression Logic:** Each level builds on previous, with clear scaffolding from basics to frontier research

### What Makes This Course Different:

**Not Just Topics, But Thinking:** The course doesn't just cover economic topics—it teaches how economists think, research, and debate. By the end, learners understand not just economic conclusions but how economists reach them.

**Expert Credibility Throughout:** Every episode features verifiable expertise—no generic "experts," business coaches, or influencers. The Nobel Prize winner count (5) and institutional affiliations (MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Fed, IMF, World Bank) establish unimpeachable credibility.

**Bridges Theory and Practice:** The course alternates between academic research (Angrist, Duflo, Tirole) and policy practice (Yellen, Bernstein, Reinhart at IMF/World Bank), showing how ideas translate to action.

**Global Perspective:** While US-heavy (reflecting podcast availability), includes French (Piketty, Tirole), African (Moyo), Chinese context (Rothman), and development focus (Duflo, Deaton) to avoid parochialism.

**Contemporary Relevance:** Episodes address current issues (trade wars, post-pandemic recovery, inflation debates) while grounding them in economic principles and historical patterns.

**Intellectual Honesty:** The course doesn't present economics as settled science. Rodrik's finale challenges globalization orthodoxy, showing learners that economic debates continue even among top experts.
