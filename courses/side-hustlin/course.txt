## FINAL COURSE DESCRIPTION (for JSON file)

Learn to build, launch, and scale profitable side hustles from the world's most successful entrepreneurs. This course takes you from zero to advanced through 18 carefully curated podcast episodes featuring founders who've built billion-dollar companies—many starting as side projects with minimal capital.

**Who You'll Learn From**: Sara Blakely (Spanx, $1B bootstrap), Brian Chesky (Airbnb, $100B+), Patrick Collison (Stripe, $50B+), Stewart Butterfield (Slack sold for $27.7B, Flickr), Drew Houston (Dropbox, $8B+ IPO), Mike Salguero (ButcherBox, $500M revenue), Daniel Ek (Spotify, $50B+), Jessica Livingston (Y Combinator co-founder, $1T portfolio), and more. These aren't theorists—they're practitioners who built real businesses from scratch.

**Your Learning Journey**:
- **Beginner**: Start with inspiring origin stories from founders who began with $5,000 or less. Learn mindset, validation, and how to take the first step without credentials or connections.
- **Intermediate**: Master launch tactics, customer acquisition, and iteration from founders who went from side projects to massive companies. Learn pivoting, pricing, and balancing your day job.
- **Advanced**: Scale operations, build systems, manage multiple income streams, and prepare for exits from serial entrepreneurs and investors who've seen thousands of companies.

**Why This Course Works**: Every episode features an expert founder being interviewed—no solo host monologues or generic advice. You'll learn from people who've actually done it: bootstrapped billion-dollar companies, sold businesses, scaled to millions of users, and built sustainable income streams. Curated from top podcasts including How I Built This, The Tim Ferriss Show, Armchair Expert, Acquired, and Lenny's Podcast.

This isn't about get-rich-quick schemes or passive income myths. It's about building real, sustainable, purpose-driven businesses—one step at a time.
