  "description": "Learn to build, launch, and scale profitable side hustles from the world's most successful entrepreneurs. This course takes you from zero to advanced through 18 carefully curated podcast episodes featuring founders who've built billion-dollar companies—many starting as side projects with minimal capital.\n\nWho You'll Learn From: Sara Blakely (Spanx, $1B bootstrap), Brian Chesky (Airbnb, $100B+), Patrick Collison (Stripe, $50B+), Melanie Perkins (Canva, $26B), Eric Yuan (Zoom, $100B+), Stewart Butterfield (Slack sold for $27.7B), Drew Houston (Dropbox, $8B+ IPO), Harley Finkelstein (Shopify President, $80B platform), Julie Wainwright (The RealReal, comeback after Pets.com), Kevin Systrom (Instagram, sold for $1B), Katrina Lake (Stitch Fix, youngest woman to IPO at 34), Mike Salguero (ButcherBox, $500M revenue), Daniel Ek (Spotify, $50B+), Jessica Livingston (Y Combinator co-founder, $1T portfolio), Tony Fadell (iPod/iPhone/Nest creator), Anne Wojcicki (23andMe, genetics pioneer), and more. These aren't theorists—they're practitioners who built real businesses from scratch.\n\nYour Learning Journey:\n• Beginner: Start with inspiring origin stories from founders who began with $5,000 or less. Learn mindset, validation, and how to take the first step without credentials or connections. Hear from founders who were rejected 100+ times, started in their teens, or launched in their 50s.\n• Intermediate: Master launch tactics, customer acquisition, and iteration from founders who went from side projects to massive companies. Learn pivoting (Slack from failed game), comebacks (The RealReal after Pets.com), pricing, personalization (Stitch Fix), and balancing growth.\n• Advanced: Scale operations, build systems, manage multiple income streams, and prepare for exits from serial entrepreneurs and investors who've seen thousands of companies. Learn from hardware legends (iPod/iPhone/Nest), genetics pioneers (23andMe), platform builders (Spotify), and Y Combinator's co-founder.\n\nWhy This Course Works: Every episode features an expert founder being interviewed—no solo host monologues or generic advice. You'll learn from people who've actually done it: bootstrapped billion-dollar companies, sold businesses for billions, scaled to millions of users, navigated FDA regulations, competed with tech giants, and built sustainable income streams. Curated from 14 diverse podcasts including How I Built This, The Tim Ferriss Show, Armchair Expert, Lex Fridman, Invest Like the Best, Acquired, Lenny's Podcast, and more.\n\nThis isn't about get-rich-quick schemes or passive income myths. It's about building real, sustainable, purpose-driven businesses—one step at a time.",
