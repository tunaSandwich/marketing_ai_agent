This course brings together Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Howard Marks, Ray Dalio, Jim Rogers, and other investing giants to teach you timeless principles that work across market cycles. You'll progress from foundational concepts to sophisticated strategies, learning directly from investors who have proven their approach works over 30, 40, even 60+ years.\n\nBeginning with accessible wisdom, you'll learn value investing from Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway chairman with 60+ year track record), index fund philosophy from Gus Sauter (Vanguard's former CIO who worked with Jack Bogle), common mistakes from Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital co-chairman whose memos are read by professionals worldwide), and principles from Ray Dalio (Bridgewater founder managing $160 billion). Barry Ritholtz (Ritholtz Wealth Management CIO managing $5+ billion) explains behavioral finance and avoiding unforced errors.\n\nThe intermediate level builds professional frameworks: Howard Marks' market cycle awareness from Goldman Sachs interviews, global macro thinking from Jim Rogers (co-founder of Quantum Fund with 4,200% returns), Charlie Munger's CEO assessment wisdom in conversation with Berkshire's Todd Combs, asset allocation strategies from Meb Faber (Cambria CIO) and Tim Antonelli (Wellington Management), and systematic risk management from quantitative experts.\n\nFinally, you'll explore advanced strategies: Howard Marks on buying assets well, activist investing from hedge fund manager Jeff Gramm, institutional portfolio management from Wellington's Jean Hynes (managing partner of $1+ trillion firm), Charlie Munger's only longform podcast interview ever on the Acquired podcast, mental models from Adam Robinson (advisor to world's top hedge funds and Warren Buffett's pen pal), and creative alpha generation strategies.
