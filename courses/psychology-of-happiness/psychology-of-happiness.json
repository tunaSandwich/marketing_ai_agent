    "description": "A practical and evidence-based course on what truly makes people happy. Drawing from decades of peer-reviewed research in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, you'll explore insights from the world's leading happiness researchers on fulfillment, meaning, and emotional well-being. Through expert interviews, cutting-edge science, and practical strategies, you'll learn how happiness can be cultivated—not just pursued—across work, relationships, and everyday life.\n\nLearn from pioneers who literally created the field of happiness science: Martin Seligman (founder of positive psychology), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who defined \"flow\"), Kristin Neff (who pioneered self-compassion research), and Jon Kabat-Zinn (creator of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction). Discover insights from Robert Waldinger, director of Harvard's 75-year study revealing relationships as the #1 predictor of happiness. Explore the neuroscience of motivation with Stanford's Andrew Huberman, the science of awe with UC Berkeley's Dacher Keltner, and the psychology of affective forecasting with Harvard's Dan Gilbert. Every expert holds a PhD or MD, teaches at a major research university, and has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe course progresses intentionally through three levels. In the beginner section, world-class researchers make happiness science accessible—explaining what we know about well-being, why relationships matter most, and how to apply evidence-based practices like gratitude and mindfulness. The intermediate level explores deeper mechanisms: how to cultivate self-compassion (Kristin Neff), achieve flow states (Csikszentmihalyi), build \"social fitness\" (Waldinger), and match happiness practices to your personality (Sonja Lyubomirsky). The advanced section tackles philosophy and meaning: Viktor Frankl's logotherapy from Holocaust survival, the \"end of history illusion\" (Gilbert), the neuroscience of awe (Keltner), post-traumatic growth (Seligman), and how scientists actually measure happiness (Laurie Santos).\n\nThis isn't self-help or pop psychology—it's rigorous science from researchers who've dedicated their careers to understanding human flourishing. By the end, you'll understand what evidence actually says about happiness, have practical strategies backed by decades of research, and grasp deeper concepts like meaning, resilience, and post-traumatic growth. You'll learn to critically evaluate happiness advice and cultivate lasting well-being through science, not pseudoscience.",
