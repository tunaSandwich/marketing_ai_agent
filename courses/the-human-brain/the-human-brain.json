    "description": "Discover how your brain creates everything you experience. This course features world-class neuroscientists from Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, UC Davis, MIT, Dartmouth, USC, and other leading institutions explaining how neurons create thoughts, memories, emotions, and decisions. Learn from Lisa Feldman Barrett (top 1% cited scientist), Anil Seth (director of consciousness research), Russell Foster (Oxford sleep scientist), Ev Fedorenko (MIT language neuroscientist), Peter Tse (Dartmouth consciousness researcher), Daniel Dennett (philosopher of mind), and other leading researchers making groundbreaking discoveries about the three-pound universe between your ears. The course progresses from accessible foundations—including how we process language and make decisions—through specific brain mechanisms to cutting-edge theories about consciousness, free will, computational neuroscience, and altered states.",
