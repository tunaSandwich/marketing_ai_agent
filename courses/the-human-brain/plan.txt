# THE HUMAN BRAIN - COURSE PLANNING DOCUMENT

## Course Vision
An immersive course that explains how the brain really works — how neurons create thoughts, memories, emotions, and decisions. Listeners will hear from neuroscientists and researchers who reveal how the mind perceives, learns, and adapts. From brain plasticity and language to consciousness and creativity, this series shows the biology behind who we are and how we think.
