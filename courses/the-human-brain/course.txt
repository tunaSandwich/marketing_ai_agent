## ALTERNATE CONFIGURATION (If Cannot Find 7 More Episodes)

If unable to source sufficient new episodes, could reconsider:
1. Using Terry Sejnowski (accept 2 Huberman Lab episodes)
2. Promoting Gregory Cooper episode (accept regional medical center)
3. Re-categorizing some intermediate as advanced
4. Using compilations/series episodes if they feature clear expert interviews

However, recommended approach is to complete additional targeted searches to maintain highest quality standards.
