- How executive function develops from infancy through preschool (ages 3-5)
- Working memory specifically: holding information in mind to think ahead
- Why attention and selective focus are foundational for executive function
- How play-based activities build executive function skills
- Why executive function at age 4 predicts later academic success
- How time concepts develop (why "15 minutes" means nothing to young children)
- Using sequencing and visual supports instead of abstract time concepts
- Research-based strategies to support executive function development

**Why This Guest/Episode Is Credible and Trustworthy**:
Dr. Clearfield's position as Professor of Psychology at Whitman College indicates she teaches developmental psychology while conducting research - dual expertise. Her published research on executive function in infants means she contributes to scientific understanding, not just popularizes others' work. The fact she's been invited back multiple times as expert indicates recognized authority in this specific area. Academic researchers must defend their findings to peer review and replicate others' work before claiming knowledge. Her research focus on the earliest emergence of executive function (in infants) shows she understands developmental foundations, not just later outcomes. Parents benefit from direct access to researcher's knowledge.

**Guest Name & Specific Credentials**:
Dr. Jen Koel
- Doctorate in education or related field (indicated by "Dr." title)
- Instructor of Early Childhood Education courses at Waukesha County Technical College
- 20+ years teaching early childhood educators
- Expertise in child development theory and theorists
- Trains future teachers and childcare providers
- Deep knowledge of developmental frameworks (Piaget, Vygotsky, Erikson, etc.)

**Expertise Signals Identified**:

✓ "Vast knowledge of child development" - descriptor from host
✓ Discusses theorists and theories - academic perspective
✓ Trains educators professionally
✓ Interview format confirmed
✓ Link to film and documentary series provided (educational resources)

**Why This Episode Fits Advanced Level**:
Understanding child development theory provides framework that organizes all parenting knowledge. Learning about major theorists (Piaget's cognitive development, Erikson's psychosocial stages, Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, Bowlby's attachment theory) helps parents see the "why" behind developmental stages. This is advanced because it's theoretical and academic rather than purely practical, though theory profoundly informs practice. Dr. Koel trains professional educators, so she can explain complex theory accessibly. Parents gain educator-level theoretical understanding.

**What the Listener Will Learn**:
- Why understanding child development theory matters for parents and educators
- Overview of major child development theorists and their contributions
- How developmental stages unfold (cognitive, social, emotional, physical)
- Dr. Koel's favorite developmental theory and why (expert perspective)
- How theory informs everyday parenting decisions
- Recognizing developmental stages in your own child
- Why children do certain things at certain ages (theoretical framework)
- How professional educators use developmental knowledge
- Connections between different developmental domains (they don't develop in isolation)

**Why This Guest/Episode Is Credible and Trustworthy**:
Dr. Koel's doctoral degree and position teaching Early Childhood Education at college level indicates deep theoretical knowledge and ability to communicate complex concepts. Instructors who train professional educators must thoroughly understand developmental theory - their students will apply this knowledge with real children. Her expertise is evaluated by institution and by students who become teachers themselves. The mention of supplementary resources (film, documentary series) shows commitment to multi-modal education. While theoretical focus makes this advanced, theory is foundation for all evidence-based practice. Parents who understand developmental theory make more informed decisions because they understand the "why" behind recommendations.
