    "description": "A grounded, compassionate course for new and soon-to-be parents navigating the first five years of a child's life. This expertly curated journey brings you the wisdom of leading pediatricians from major children's hospitals, clinical psychologists with decades of experience, developmental researchers from top universities, and renowned parenting practitioners. You'll learn from experts like Dr. Becky Kennedy (Clinical Psychologist, Columbia PhD, TIME Magazine's \"Millennial Parenting Whisperer\"), Dr. Tina Payne Bryson (co-author of The Whole-Brain Child with Dr. Daniel Siegel), Janet Lansbury (trained by RIE founder Magda Gerber), and professors actively researching executive function and cognitive development at institutions like UNC and Whitman College.\n\nThe course follows a thoughtfully designed progression through three levels. Beginner episodes (ages 0-2) build your foundation with essential concepts: attachment, respectful parenting, developmental milestones, brain-based discipline (the \"Yes Brain\"), and evidence-based sleep guidance. You'll understand what's normal, develop core parenting philosophy, and gain confidence in your approach. Intermediate episodes (ages 2-4) tackle specific challenges you'll face: tantrums, sleep regressions, picky eating, language development, and emotional regulation in both neurotypical and neurodivergent children. Each episode features medical doctors, licensed psychologists, or experienced practitioners with specialized knowledge.\n\nAdvanced episodes (ages 3-5) explore cutting-edge research that shapes long-term outcomes: executive function development, cognitive flexibility, resilience-building, and the science of play as emotional development tool. You'll hear directly from professors conducting research at major universities, executive function specialists working with real families, and experts synthesizing decades of attachment science and neuroscience into practical wisdom.\n\nWhat makes this course trustworthy is the caliber of expertise: every episode features identifiable experts with verifiable credentials—MDs from children's hospitals, PhDs from respected research institutions, licensed therapists with 20+ years experience, published authors of bestselling parenting books, and researchers actively contributing to scientific literature. You're not getting parenting bloggers or influencers; you're learning from the same experts pediatricians, psychologists, and educators learn from. This course helps you raise a secure, curious, resilient child while maintaining your own sanity and connection—grounded in science, delivered with compassion.",
