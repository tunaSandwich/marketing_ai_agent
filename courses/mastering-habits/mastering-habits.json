  "description": "Why we do what we do—and how to reprogram it. This groundbreaking course brings together the world's leading experts on habits, featuring researchers, Stanford professors, Pulitzer Prize winners, and MacArthur Fellows. Learn from the scientists whose research created the field of habit science.\n\nIn Beginner Level, you'll learn the fundamentals from James Clear (Atomic Habits), BJ Fogg (Tiny Habits, Stanford), Wendy Wood (30 years of habit research), Charles Duhigg (Pulitzer winner), Katy Milkman (Wharton professor), and Angela Duckworth (MacArthur Fellow). Discover the habit loop, how to start tiny, why environment beats willpower, and how to build grit for lasting change.\n\nIntermediate Level deepens your understanding with Judson Brewer (MD/PhD on mindfulness and addiction neuroscience), Katy Milkman critically examining what research really shows, Roy Baumeister (world's leading willpower researcher with 700+ publications), and advanced applications from Wendy Wood, Nir Eyal, and BJ Fogg. Master clinical approaches, think critically about the science, and learn sophisticated behavior design.\n\nAdvanced Level takes you to the research frontier with Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) on dopamine and neural circuits, Judson Brewer on clinical neuroscience of addiction, Wendy Wood on the latest research, Roy Baumeister on free will and theoretical implications, and Katy Milkman on cutting-edge mega-study methodology. Understand brain mechanisms, philosophical implications, and research methods at the field's leading edge.\n\nWhat makes this course authoritative: Every expert holds a PhD, MD, or equivalent research credentials. Maximum diversity with 18 different podcasts and 9 expert voices. All insights backed by peer-reviewed research. You'll learn not just what to do, but why it works, and how to think critically about habit science. By the end, you'll have learned from the world's best researchers on why we do what we do—and exactly how to reprogram it.",
