## "Why we do what we do—and how to reprogram it"

Date: 2025-11-03

---

## COURSE PURPOSE

This course teaches the science and practice of habit formation and behavior change. We'll take learners from basic understanding of what habits are and how they form, through practical techniques for building good habits and breaking bad ones, all the way to cutting-edge neuroscience and research frontiers.

**Target Audience**: Anyone who wants to understand why they do what they do and gain evidence-based tools to change their behavior.

**Core Promise**: Learn from the world's leading psychologists, neuroscientists, and behavioral scientists who have spent decades researching habits, decision-making, and behavior change.
