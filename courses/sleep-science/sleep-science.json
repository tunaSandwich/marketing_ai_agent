    "description": "Sleep is the foundation of human health, affecting everything from your daily energy and mood to your long-term cognitive health and lifespan. Yet most of us don't truly understand how sleep works or how to optimize it. This expertly curated course takes you on a comprehensive journey through sleep science, from fundamental concepts to cutting-edge research, taught by the world's leading sleep researchers, neuroscientists, and clinicians. You'll learn from UC Berkeley's Matthew Walker (author of \"Why We Sleep\"), Stanford's Andrew Huberman, Harvard-trained sleep specialists, Johns Hopkins researchers, and Mayo Clinic clinicians—the most credentialed experts in sleep science.\n\nThe course is structured as a progressive learning path designed to build your knowledge systematically. The beginner level establishes why sleep matters and how to improve it immediately, featuring accessible explanations from top experts including three episodes with Matthew Walker (the world's foremost sleep authority) and practical protocols from Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. The intermediate level dives deep into mechanisms—circadian biology with chronobiology specialists, longevity connections with Dr. Peter Attia, and optimization strategies through nutrition and lifestyle interventions with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. The advanced level explores the frontier: evidence-based clinical treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia from leading researchers), cutting-edge neuroscience (the glymphatic system's role in brain detoxification), and world-class chronobiology expertise from the President of the World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology.\n\nWhat makes this course uniquely valuable is the caliber of expertise: every episode features a credentialed expert with verifiable academic, research, or clinical credentials from institutions like UC Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins, and Mayo Clinic. You're not learning sleep tips from wellness influencers—you're learning from the researchers conducting the studies, the clinicians treating patients, and the neuroscientists publishing in top journals. The course spans 18 carefully selected episodes from diverse podcasts, ensuring you get multiple perspectives while maintaining the highest standards of scientific rigor.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll understand not just what to do for better sleep, but why it works at biological, neurological, and cellular levels. You'll know how to optimize your sleep for energy and mood today, while protecting your brain health and extending your healthspan for decades to come. Whether you struggle with insomnia, want to enhance performance, or simply wish to understand one of neuroscience's most fascinating topics, this course provides authoritative, evidence-based knowledge from the world's leading experts. Your journey to mastering sleep science—and transforming your health—starts here.",
