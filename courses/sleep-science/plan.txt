# Sleep Science Course - Strategic Plan

## Course Overview
Create an educational learning path on "Sleep Science - Optimizing sleep for energy, mood, and longevity" that takes listeners from basic understanding through advanced research frontiers. Focus on expert-backed science, avoiding wellness influencers and focusing on credentialed researchers, clinicians, and neuroscientists.

## Beginner Level Strategy
**Goal**: Build foundational understanding of sleep basics through accessible expert interviews

**Key Topics**:
- What is sleep and why do we need it?
- Sleep stages (REM, NREM, deep sleep) explained
- Circadian rhythms and the biological clock
- Common sleep myths debunked
- Basic sleep hygiene principles
- How sleep affects energy, mood, and cognition

**Ideal Format**: Well-known hosts (Lex Fridman, Tim Ferriss, Rick Rubin) interviewing world-class sleep researchers or doctors who can make complex science accessible

## Intermediate Level Strategy
**Goal**: Deep dive into mechanisms, systems, and evidence-based optimization

**Key Topics**:
- Sleep architecture and neurophysiology
- Hormonal regulation (melatonin, cortisol, adenosine)
- Light exposure and circadian entrainment
- Effects of sleep deprivation on health
- Temperature, timing, and environmental factors
- Evidence-based interventions and protocols
- Sleep tracking and metrics that matter
- Relationship between sleep and metabolism/immunity

**Ideal Format**: Subject-specific podcasts (health/science shows) interviewing sleep researchers, neuroscientists, or clinicians with deep domain expertise

## Advanced Level Strategy
**Goal**: Cutting-edge research, debates, and frontier topics in sleep science

**Key Topics**:
- Chronobiology and molecular mechanisms
- Sleep's role in longevity and healthspan
- Glymphatic system and brain waste clearance
- Sleep disorders: mechanisms and treatments
- Pharmacology of sleep aids and consequences
- Sleep and neuroplasticity/learning consolidation
- Genetic factors in sleep requirements
- Future of sleep medicine and interventions
- Debates in sleep research (optimal sleep duration, polyphasic sleep, etc.)

**Ideal Format**: Technical podcasts featuring leading researchers, conference presentations, academic discussions exploring frontiers of sleep science

## High-Quality Podcasts to Target

**Priority Tier 1 (Most Likely to Have Excellent Sleep Content):**
- Huberman Lab (Andrew Huberman frequently covers sleep, interviews sleep experts)

- Found My Fitness (Rhonda Patrick - sleep and health optimization)
- Lex Fridman Podcast (when interviewing sleep/neuroscience researchers)
- Tim Ferriss Show (when featuring sleep researchers or optimization experts)

**Priority Tier 2 (Strong General Interview Podcasts):**
- The Knowledge Project
- Making Sense (Sam Harris)
- Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin
- On Being
- Fresh Air (NPR)
- TED Talks Daily / TED Radio Hour

**Priority Tier 3 (Science/Health Focused):**
- Sean Carroll's Mindscape
- Hidden Brain
- Radiolab
- Science Vs
- StarTalk

**Priority Tier 4 (Subject-Specific - Look for these):**
- Sleep-specific podcasts (e.g., "Sleep Research Podcast")
- Neuroscience podcasts
- Medical/clinical podcasts featuring sleep medicine
- University-affiliated health podcasts
