## NOTES FOR FINAL SELECTION

**Dr. Stacy Sims Multiple Episodes - Justification:**
Dr. Stacy Sims appears 4 times, which exceeds typical diversity guidelines. However, this could be justified because:
1. She is THE world's leading expert on women and exercise/nutrition
2. Each episode covers different aspects (general perimenopause, 45+ advanced, sex differences comparison, nutrition science)
3. Her research is groundbreaking and not replicated by others
4. Alternative: Could reduce to best 2-3 of her episodes and find other experts

**Recommendation:** Keep 3 Dr. Sims episodes (one per level) and replace one with different expert for diversity.

**Missing Beginner Topics:**
- Need basic hormone education (estrogen, progesterone basics)
- OR birth control medical overview
- OR menstrual cycle 101 with clear medical expert
