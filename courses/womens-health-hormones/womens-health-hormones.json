    "description": "From the menstrual cycle to menopause, hormones orchestrate nearly every aspect of women's health—shaping energy, mood, metabolism, fertility, and long-term wellbeing. Yet for too long, women's health has been understudied, misunderstood, and oversimplified. This comprehensive course brings together leading medical experts, researchers, and specialists to provide the science-based knowledge women deserve.\n\nYou'll learn from Yale professors, board-certified OB/GYNs, reproductive endocrinologists from top fertility centers, and pioneering researchers from Stanford and Duke. These aren't just doctors explaining concepts—they're the specialists women see when facing fertility challenges, navigating perimenopause, managing PCOS or endometriosis, or making critical decisions about hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Stacy Sims, the world's leading expert on female physiology and exercise, reveals why \"women are not small men\" and how training and nutrition must adapt across hormonal shifts. Endocrinologists from Duke and Wake Forest explain thyroid disorders that disproportionately affect women. Active researchers share cutting-edge studies on endometriosis treatment decisions and fertility outcomes.\n\nThe course progression mirrors a woman's journey of understanding: Beginner episodes build foundational knowledge with accessible experts explaining hormone basics, menstrual cycle physiology, fertility fundamentals, and menopause symptoms. Intermediate episodes dive deeper into specific conditions like PCOS, explore IVF and fertility treatments, and reveal how to optimize nutrition and exercise across your cycle. Advanced episodes tackle complex topics—HRT decision-making from a longevity perspective, the latest research on women over 45, sex differences in physiology that researchers are only now uncovering, and autoimmune thyroid conditions.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll understand how to work with your biology—not against it—through evidence-based nutrition, movement, stress management, and medical insight. Whether you're navigating fertility, optimizing athletic performance, approaching perimenopause, or simply want to understand your hormonal health, you'll come away empowered with knowledge from the doctors and researchers shaping the future of women's health.",
