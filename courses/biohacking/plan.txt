# BIOHACKING COURSE - PLANNING DOCUMENT

## Course Purpose and Learning Objectives

This course will guide listeners through evidence-based biohacking strategies to optimize cognitive performance and physical vitality. The focus is on practical, scientifically-backed tools and protocols that can be implemented to feel sharper mentally and stronger physically.

Unlike general health courses, this course emphasizes actionable biohacks—specific interventions with measurable effects on performance. We're looking for episodes featuring credentialed experts (MDs, PhDs, researchers) discussing practical tools: nootropics, cold/heat exposure, fasting protocols, supplement stacks, sleep optimization techniques, exercise timing, circadian rhythm hacks, and quantified self approaches.

The learning journey takes listeners from foundational practices anyone can implement, through mechanistic understanding of how these interventions work at the biological level, to cutting-edge protocols used by performance researchers and elite practitioners.
