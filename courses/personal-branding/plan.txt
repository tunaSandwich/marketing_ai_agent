## Common Personal Branding Course Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Influencer vs. Expert Confusion**
   - Having a large following ≠ expertise in brand building
   - Look for those who TEACH brand building, not just those who have built one

2. **Tactical Without Strategic**
   - Avoid episodes that are purely "10 LinkedIn tips" without underlying principles
   - Need strategic frameworks, not just tactics

3. **Motivational Without Substance**
   - Inspirational stories are great, but need actionable insights and frameworks
   - Avoid generic motivation without specific brand-building guidance

4. **Self-Promotion Disguised as Education**
   - Some episodes are really just selling the guest's services
   - Look for genuine teaching and research-backed insights

5. **Outdated Platform Advice**
   - Social media changes rapidly
   - Prefer timeless principles over platform-specific tactics (unless very recent)

6. **Ignoring Ethics and Authenticity**
   - Personal branding can feel manipulative
   - Prioritize experts who address authenticity, ethics, and sustainable approaches
