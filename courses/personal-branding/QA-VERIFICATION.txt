---

### ✅ 12. Logical flow within each level

**VERIFIED:** YES

**BEGINNER Level Logical Flow:**
1. **WHAT** is personal branding → (Jill Avery/HBS definition)
2. **WHY** authenticity matters → (Brené Brown/vulnerability psychology)
3. **HOW** to find purpose → (Simon Sinek/Start With Why)
4. **MODERN** tactics → (Gary V/digital age)
5. **STRATEGIC** thinking → (Seth Godin/marketing mindset)
6. **BASIC** communication → (Dianna Booher/presence fundamentals)

**Progression Logic:** Definition → Mindset → Purpose → Modern Context → Strategy → Communication
**Rationale:** Must understand what branding is before addressing psychological barriers, find purpose before tactics, learn strategy before communication skills.

**INTERMEDIATE Level Logical Flow:**
1. **WORKPLACE** application of vulnerability → (Brené + Adam)
2. **WORK CULTURE** dynamics → (Adam Grant/organizational context)
3. **STORYTELLING** techniques → (Matthew Dicks)
4. **STORY** patterns → (Nancy Duarte/systematic structures)
5. **REINVENTION** framework → (Dorie Clark/evolution)
6. **EXECUTIVE** presence mastery → (Dr. Laura Camacho/neuroscience)

**Progression Logic:** Apply fundamentals to work → Understand culture context → Learn storytelling techniques → Master story patterns → Evolve brand strategically → Build executive presence
**Rationale:** Builds on beginner communication by applying to workplace, then teaches sophisticated communication (storytelling), then brand evolution, culminating in executive presence.

**ADVANCED Level Logical Flow:**
1. **AUTHORITY** building → (Rusty Shelton/thought leadership foundation)
2. **EVANGELISM** → (Guy Kawasaki/scaling through advocates)
3. **REPUTATION** management → (Alison Kluger/Stanford frameworks)
4. **BEHAVIORAL** science → (Daniel Pink/psychology of influence)
5. **LEADERSHIP** at scale → (Chuck Garcia/Bloomberg high-stakes)
6. **CRISIS** management → (Bill Coletti/ultimate test)

**Progression Logic:** Build authority → Scale through evangelism → Manage reputation → Understand influence psychology → Lead at highest levels → Survive crises
**Rationale:** Authority is foundation for scaling, reputation management protects what you've built, behavioral science explains why influence works, leadership applies it, crisis management is ultimate advanced skill.
