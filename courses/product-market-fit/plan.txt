# Finding Product-Market Fit Course - Comprehensive Plan

## Course Vision

Create the definitive course on Product-Market Fit - "that magical moment when customers can't live without your product." This course will demystify the holy grail of entrepreneurship through stories, frameworks, and insights from entrepreneurs who've actually achieved PMF.

**Target Audience**: Founders, product managers, and entrepreneurs struggling to find or validate product-market fit.

**Unique Value**: Not just inspirational founder stories - this is systematic education in the most important concept in entrepreneurship, taught exclusively by people who've achieved it at scale.

## Level Progression Strategy

### BEGINNER LEVEL: "What PMF Actually Feels Like"

**Core Question**: How do you KNOW when you have product-market fit?

**Learning Outcomes**:
1. Recognize the qualitative signs: customers pulling, organic growth, retention without pushing
2. Understand Marc Andreessen's "market pulling product out of you" viscerally through stories
3. See the contrast between pre-PMF (pushing boulder uphill) vs post-PMF (can't keep up with demand)
4. Learn from pivot stories: what it looks like to NOT have PMF, then find it
5. Understand why "talking to customers" is not just advice, but survival

**Episode Characteristics**:
- Famous founder on top-tier interview podcast (How I Built This, Lex Fridman, Tim Ferriss)
- Storytelling format, accessible to non-technical audience
- Clear "before/after" PMF narrative
- Honest about struggles and false starts
- Inspiring but grounded in reality

**Target Companies/Founders**:
- Airbnb (Brian Chesky) - selling cereal, finding travel niche, COVID survival
- Slack (Stewart Butterfield) - gaming company pivot to workplace tool
- DoorDash (Tony Xu) - literally delivering food themselves to validate
- Instagram (Kevin Systrom) - stripped down Burbn to just photo filters
- Stripe (Patrick Collison) - solving painful developer problem
- Dropbox (Drew Houston) - video proof before building

   - Sean Ellis test (40% "very disappointed")
   - Retention curves (flattening = PMF)
   - Cohort analysis
   - Net Promoter Score interpretation
4. Iteration Cadence: Weekly? Monthly? How to know when to pivot?
5. Early Adopter Psychology: Building for the fringes first (Geoffrey Moore)
6. Problem-Solution Fit: Validating BEFORE building
7. Founder-Market Fit: Why domain expertise matters

**Episode Characteristics**:
- Founders who used specific methodologies/frameworks

### ADVANCED LEVEL: "PMF at Scale & Edge Cases"

1. Scaling PMF: Does it hold as you grow? How to maintain it?
2. Multi-Product PMF: When to launch product #2? Does PMF transfer?
3. Marketplace PMF: Two-sided networks (chicken-egg, liquidity)
4. Enterprise PMF: Long sales cycles, different validation signals
5. Geographic Expansion: Does PMF translate across countries/cultures?
6. Platform PMF: Ecosystem effects, developer adoption
7. PMF Degradation: When/why you lose it (market shifts, competition)
8. Timing & Market Waves: Being too early or too late

**Episode Characteristics**:
- Serial founders (2nd+ company) reflecting on patterns
- VCs with decades of pattern recognition across markets
