ID: 32687
Title: Slack & Flickr: Stewart Butterfield
Podcast: How I Built This (Podcast ID: 188)
Host: Guy Raz

DESCRIPTION:
"In the early 2000s, Stewart Butterfield tried to build a weird, massively multiplayer online game, but the venture failed. Instead, he and his co-founders used the technology they developed to create the photo-sharing site Flickr. After Flickr was acquired by Yahoo in 2005, Butterfield went back to the online game idea, only to fail again. But the office messaging platform Slack rose from the ashes of that second failure — a company which, today, is valued at over $5 billion."

WHY THIS FITS BEGINNER:
- Perfect "pivot" story showing how PMF reveals itself
- Accessible narrative about recognizing what users actually want
- Shows perseverance through failure

It opened up people's homes, creating an army of Superhosts in the process, bringing tourists and locals far closer together. It's no short of lie that Airbnb created a travel revolution. So you could say today's episode is both Brian's and Airbnb's. For a CEO of his magnitude, it's clearly hard for him to separate the two. The story of how Airbnb came to be, is not what you'd expect.
