  "description": "Master the art and science of understanding, regulating, and leveraging emotions in work and life through this comprehensive 18-episode course featuring world-leading experts in psychology, neuroscience, and organizational behavior.\n\nThis course takes you on a transformative journey from foundational concepts to cutting-edge research. You'll learn from the pioneers who literally created these fields: Daniel Goleman, who coined \"emotional intelligence\"; Brené Brown, whose groundbreaking research on vulnerability has transformed millions of lives; Martin Seligman, the father of positive psychology; and Lisa Feldman Barrett, whose revolutionary theory of constructed emotions is reshaping neuroscience.\n\nThe beginner level establishes core concepts through accessible, expert-guided explorations of what emotional intelligence is, why it matters, and how emotions work. You'll discover the RULER framework from Yale, learn to read facial expressions with the scientist who inspired the TV show \"Lie to Me,\" and understand how optimism and hope shape our emotional lives.\n\nThe intermediate level applies these foundations to real-world challenges. Leading researchers from Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, and Penn share evidence-based strategies for workplace emotional intelligence, developing self-awareness, building empathy, achieving emotional agility, managing stress, and preventing burnout. These episodes bridge theory and practice, giving you tools to navigate the complexities of professional and personal relationships.\n\nThe advanced level explores the frontiers of emotion science. You'll dive into the neuroscience of how our brains construct emotions, how meditation changes neural pathways, how teams develop collective emotional intelligence, and how psychological safety enables innovation. The course culminates with profound insights into consciousness itself, exploring how our physical bodies and brains create the very experience of being emotionally aware.\n\nWhat makes this course uniquely authoritative is the caliber of expertise: professors from Yale, Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Penn, and other leading institutions; pioneers who founded entire fields of study; top 1% most-cited scientists; authors of multiple bestsellers; and researchers whose work has been recognized by TIME Magazine, the American Psychological Association, and Harvard Business Review as groundbreaking.\n\nYou'll gain not just knowledge, but practical skills: recognizing and regulating your emotions, reading others accurately, building genuine empathy, navigating difficult conversations, managing stress constructively, creating psychological safety, and aligning your emotional life with your deepest values. Whether you're a leader looking to inspire teams, a professional seeking career advancement, or simply someone who wants to live with greater emotional wisdom, this course offers a research-backed roadmap to flourishing.",
