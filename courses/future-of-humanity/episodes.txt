## NOTES ON PODCAST DIVERSITY

Podcasts used so far:
1. The Knowledge Project (Shane Parrish) ✓
2. The Tim Ferriss Show ✓
3. New Frontiers Podcast ✓
4. Zestology ✓
5. Future of Life Institute Podcast ✓
6. TED Talks Daily ✓
7. Lex Fridman Podcast (used twice - need to evaluate if acceptable) ⚠️
8. Regulating AI Podcast ✓
9. EconTalk (used twice for different guests) ⚠️
10. Unknown specialized longevity podcast ✓

**CONCERN:** Lex Fridman used twice (Stuart Russell, Nick Bostrom), EconTalk used twice (Bostrom, Harari).
**DECISION NEEDED:** The plan says "18 different podcasts" but we have exceptional episodes on these podcasts. May need to choose one per podcast or justify using same podcast twice if guests are sufficiently different.

Actually, rereading plan: "maximum diversity" and "18 different podcasts" is the goal. Should aim for this if possible.

**REVISED APPROACH:** Select only ONE episode per podcast where possible. Keep best one from each podcast.

16. Making Sense ✓
17. 80,000 Hours Podcast ✓

**PROBLEM:** Lex Fridman used twice (Nick Bostrom and Michio Kaku)

**SOLUTION:** Need to choose ONE Lex Fridman episode. Replace the other with different podcast.

**DECISION:**
- KEEP: Nick Bostrom on Lex Fridman (Advanced) - simulation/superintelligence is perfectly suited to advanced level
- REPLACE: Michio Kaku - find alternative space/physics episode OR use Michio Kaku from different podcast

**Alternative for A6:**
Actually, looking back at my search results, I should use Nick Bostrom on EconTalk instead of Lex Fridman, since I'm already using Lex for Kaku. But wait - I'm using EconTalk for Yuval Harari!

Let me reconsider the entire selection to ensure 18 different podcasts...

**REVISED APPROACH:**
- Yuval Harari is on EconTalk - KEEP (perfect for Beginner)
- Nick Bostrom has episode on BOTH Lex Fridman and EconTalk - Use Lex Fridman version
- Michio Kaku is on Lex Fridman - This creates duplicate

**NEW SOLUTION for A6 - Replace Michio Kaku:**
Looking at space/physics options:
- Sean Carroll has another episode on StarTalk or The Astral Hustle
- Could use specialized physics/future podcast

Actually, let me reconsider... I'll keep Michio Kaku but find him on a DIFFERENT podcast. Let me check my results...

From my results: Michio Kaku also appears on:
- Marginalia Podcast (58673)
- The Long Now Foundation (280)

Let me use The Long Now Foundation - that's a prestigious podcast!

**FINAL REVISION FOR A6:**
- **ID:** 30033132
- **Title:** "Michio Kaku"
- **Podcast:** The Long Now Foundation (280)
- **Guest:** Michio Kaku, PhD
- **Why Selected:** Visionary physicist, same content focus, different podcast ensures diversity
