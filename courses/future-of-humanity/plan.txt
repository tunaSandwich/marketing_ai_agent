## Notes

- When searching, Elasticsearch returns results by relevance score - this is just search matching, NOT quality rating
- All search results should be documented in results.txt with full descriptions for later evaluation
- Episode evaluation happens AFTER search - don't judge quality during search phase
- Quality assessment requires reading full descriptions and verifying guest credentials
- Better to do more searches (25+) and find exceptional episodes than rush with fewer searches
- Diversity matters: 18 different podcasts shows broader perspective than repeating same shows
- Guest diversity also matters: Seek varied perspectives and approaches within each domain
- When uncertain about episode quality, err on side of being MORE selective
- Course quality depends entirely on expert credibility - never compromise on this standard
- If struggling to find 6 good episodes for a level, expand search with:
  - Different high-quality podcast names
  - Alternative keyword combinations
  - Subtopic searches
  - University/institution podcasts
  - Conference recordings or lecture series

## Success Criteria

This course will be successful if:

1. **Expert Quality:** Every episode features a genuine expert with verifiable credentials actively working in their field
2. **Learning Progression:** A beginner could start at episode 1 and progressively build understanding through episode 18
3. **Diversity:** 18 different podcasts showing varied perspectives and approaches
4. **Credibility:** Each guest has a track record (publications, companies, breakthroughs) that validates their expertise
5. **Depth:** Episodes go beyond surface-level futurism to substantive insights grounded in research
6. **Inspiration:** After completing the course, listeners feel informed, inspired, and equipped to think about humanity's long-term future
7. **Balance:** Course covers multiple domains (space, AI, longevity, philosophy) without overweighting any single area
8. **Trust:** Listeners trust the course because every expert's credentials are transparent and verifiable
