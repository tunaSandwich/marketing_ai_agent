## SEARCH 26: "Elon Musk SpaceX Mars colonization"
Total Results: 10,000+

NOTABLE EPISODES:
- ID: 62336277 | "How Elon Musk and SpaceX plan to colonize Mars" | The Daily (NYT) (336761)
- Various episodes ABOUT Elon Musk rather than interviews WITH him

ASSESSMENT: Many results are about Elon Musk rather than interviews with him. The Daily (NYT) episode may feature reporting/analysis rather than direct interview. Need to be cautious - may not meet our interview format criteria. Will likely skip most of these.
