    "description": "What makes people actually want to follow you? This course answers that question through 18 carefully curated episodes featuring the world's leading researchers, Fortune 500 executives, and battle-tested practitioners. You'll learn from Harvard professors who've spent decades studying team dynamics, CEOs who've transformed iconic companies, Navy SEALs who've led in life-or-death situations, and organizational psychologists whose research defines modern leadership. Each episode is a substantive interview with a recognized authority—no generic advice or solo monologues, only expert insights you can trust.\n\nYour journey begins with foundational principles: Jocko Willink teaches extreme ownership from the battlefield, Simon Sinek explains why purpose matters, and Brené Brown reveals vulnerability as a strength backed by 20 years of research. The intermediate level explores the science and systems behind inspirational leadership—Amy Edmondson (Harvard's #1 management thinker) on psychological safety, Patty McCord on Netflix's legendary culture, Adam Grant (Wharton's top professor) on motivation, and Daniel Goleman on emotional intelligence. You'll master frameworks like Kim Scott's Radical Candor and Patrick Lencioni's Five Dysfunctions that are used by thousands of organizations worldwide.\n\nThe advanced level elevates you to organizational transformation and leadership frontiers. You'll study adaptive leadership theory with Professor Mary Uhl-Bien, learn how Satya Nadella transformed Microsoft's culture and grew the company by $1.5 trillion, and explore cutting-edge research on building fearless organizations and grounded confidence. Each level builds deliberately—from personal leadership to team dynamics to organizational change—ensuring you develop both the mindset and the practical skills that make people genuinely want to follow.\n\nThis course represents hundreds of years of combined expertise: tenured professors at Harvard, Wharton, and TCU; executives from Google, Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft; military leaders from Navy SEAL Teams; and bestselling authors whose frameworks define modern management. You'll achieve perfect balance—50% female experts, 50% male; academic rigor meets practitioner wisdom; psychological research meets battlefield experience. Every expert has verifiable credentials, proven track records, and practical frameworks you can apply immediately. This isn't inspiration without substance—it's the science and art of leadership that actually works.",
