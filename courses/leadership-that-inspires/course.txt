- "Host of original podcasts Unlocking Us and Dare to Lead"
- Clear interview format with Jessi Hempel
- Focus on "grounded confidence" - newer, more advanced concept

WHY IT FITS ADVANCED LEVEL:

For advanced leaders, it's about balancing vulnerability with competence and confidence.

WHAT THE LISTENER WILL LEARN:
- The concept of "grounded confidence" and why it matters
- Advanced vulnerability: when to share, what to share, with whom
- The difference between vulnerability and "oversharing" or "trauma dumping"
- Why human skills (EQ, empathy, vulnerability) are becoming more critical as AI advances
- How to build vulnerability practices into organizational systems
- The relationship between vulnerability, trust, and performance at scale
- Latest research on shame, courage, and leadership

WHY THIS GUEST IS CREDIBLE:
Same world-class credentials as beginner level, but this represents her latest thinking after 20+ years of research. Her evolution from basic vulnerability research to "grounded confidence" shows sophisticated understanding of how these concepts work in complex organizational settings.

While the intermediate episode covered what Netflix's culture is, this advanced episode explores the architecture and design choices. More granular for leaders building culture from scratch.

WHAT THE LISTENER WILL LEARN:

- How to make difficult trade-offs in culture design (freedom vs. control)
- Why they eliminated performance reviews, vacation policies, etc. - the reasoning

- The relationship between culture and business strategy
- How culture scales as organizations grow rapidly

WHY THIS GUEST IS CREDIBLE:
Same exceptional credentials as intermediate level, but this episode goes meta - exploring the creation process itself. The Netflix Culture Deck is studied as one of the most influential business documents of the 21st century.

- Framework creator with proven application
- Interview format
