================================================================================
REJECTED EPISODES - DID NOT MEET QUALITY STANDARDS
================================================================================

❌ REJECTED: Most "Masters of Scale" search results
REASON: Returned summaries, trailers, and meta-content rather than actual Reid Hoffman interviews
NOTE: Need to search more specifically for actual Masters of Scale guest episodes

❌ REJECTED: Most "How I Built This" search results
REASON: Generic results, no specific founder interviews identified
NOTE: Need episode-specific searches like "How I Built This [Specific Founder]"

❌ REJECTED: Generic "leadership" titled episodes without clear guests
REASON: No identifiable expert credentials, appears to be host monologues or generic content

❌ REJECTED: "Lenny's Daily Podcast" results
REASON: Wrong podcast - sports betting content, not Lenny Rachitsky's product leadership podcast

❌ REJECTED: Generic "Tim Ferriss" results
REASON: Many were about Tim rather than interviews Tim conducted with leadership experts

❌ REJECTED: "Lex Fridman CEO" generic results
REASON: Did not return specific CEO interviews, just general Lex Fridman content
