# Course Plan: "Crypto Decrypted"

## Course Purpose
A clear, educational journey through the technology, philosophy, and mechanics of cryptocurrency and blockchain. You'll learn how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major systems actually function, why they were created, and how cryptography and decentralization reshape trust, finance, and the internet itself. This isn't about price speculation — it's about understanding the architecture and ideas that define Web3.

- Basic cryptography: public/private keys, hashing, digital signatures
- What is decentralization and why does it matter?
- Digital scarcity and solving the double-spend problem
- Introduction to Ethereum and smart contracts
- The difference between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other protocols

### Core Mechanics/Systems (Intermediate Level)
- Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake: consensus mechanisms explained
- How mining works (and why it's energy-intensive)
- How validators and staking work in PoS systems
- Smart contract mechanics and how DeFi protocols operate
- Tokenomics: protocol design, incentives, and game theory
- Layer 2 scaling solutions: Lightning Network, Rollups (Optimistic & ZK)
- Cryptographic primitives: Merkle trees, hash functions, elliptic curve cryptography
- Security: attack vectors, 51% attacks, smart contract vulnerabilities

### Research Frontiers/Debates (Advanced Level)
- Zero-knowledge proofs: zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and privacy technology

## Quality Assurance for Crypto Course

### MUST HAVE:
✅ Clear technical credentials (developer, professor, protocol founder, cryptographer)
✅ Interview format (not solo host monologue)
✅ Focus on TECHNOLOGY not price speculation or "get rich" schemes
✅ Technical depth (discusses cryptography, consensus, protocol mechanics)
✅ Practitioner experience (actually built protocols, wrote code, researched crypto)
✅ No pump-and-dump schemes or scam tokens

### RED FLAGS:
❌ No credentials mentioned in description
❌ Focus on price predictions, "get rich quick", or investment hype
❌ Solo host explaining crypto from secondary sources (Wikipedia, articles)
❌ Hype/marketing without technical substance
❌ Promoting specific tokens without technical merit
❌ "Crypto guru" personalities without engineering/research background
❌ Spiritual/mystical interpretations of blockchain technology
❌ Financial advice or trading strategies (we want technology education)

### Technology vs Speculation:
This course is about HOW crypto works, not WHY you should invest:
✅ GOOD: "How does Bitcoin's Proof of Work consensus mechanism secure the network?"
✅ GOOD: "What are the trade-offs between Optimistic and ZK Rollups?"
✅ GOOD: "How do zk-SNARKs enable privacy on public blockchains?"

❌ BAD: "Why Bitcoin will reach $100k"
❌ BAD: "Top 10 altcoins to buy now"
❌ BAD: "How to get rich with crypto"
