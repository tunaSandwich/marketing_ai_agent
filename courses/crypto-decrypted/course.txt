- Cutting-edge research: internalizing externalities in DeFi

WHY THIS GUEST/EPISODE IS CREDIBLE:
This episode brings together UMA (oracle protocol builders) and Flashbots (MEV researchers) to discuss their collaboration on Oval. Both teams are at the frontier of their respective fields: oracles and MEV. This is protocol-level innovation discussed by the teams actually building it. Bell Curve podcast focuses on crypto research, providing technical depth.

LOGICAL FLOW: After general MEV, explore the specific frontier of Oracle Extractable Value.

EPISODE 17: Smart Contract Development & Security (Ethereum Foundation Perspective)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode ID: 30566842
Title: "82. Nicolás Serrano - Blockchain Developer"
Podcast ID: 210594
Podcast Name: Unknown (Developer/Tech Podcast)

GUEST CREDENTIALS:
- Sreeram Kannan: Founder of EigenLayer
- Professor at University of Washington (Computer Science)
- Researcher in distributed systems, consensus, and blockchain
- Created novel "restaking" primitive for Ethereum

EXPERTISE SIGNALS IDENTIFIED:
- Academic credential: University of Washington professor
- Founded EigenLayer (novel protocol innovation)
- Topics: Re-staking, programmable slashing, proof-of-stake innovation
- Epicenter interview (technical depth)
- Researcher + practitioner (academic + protocol founder)

WHY THIS EPISODE FITS ADVANCED LEVEL:
EigenLayer is a novel protocol that allows Ethereum validators to "restake" their ETH to secure other protocols (bridges, oracles, rollups). This creates a shared security layer: instead of every protocol bootstrapping its own validator set, they can rent Ethereum's security. Understanding restaking requires grasping proof-of-stake, slashing conditions, protocol composability, and trust assumptions—advanced protocol design concepts. This is cutting-edge research (2023-2024 innovation).

WHAT THE LISTENER WILL LEARN:
- What restaking is: reusing staked ETH to secure additional protocols
- How EigenLayer creates programmable slashing conditions
- Why shared security matters (reducing fragmentation)
- How bridges, oracles, and rollups can use restaked ETH
- Protocol-level composability and security assumptions
- Novel consensus and incentive design (extending PoS)

WHY THIS GUEST/EPISODE IS CREDIBLE:
Sreeram Kannan is a computer science professor who founded EigenLayer, one of the most innovative protocol designs in recent years. He brings both academic rigor (distributed systems research) and practitioner experience (built the protocol). EigenLayer has attracted massive interest from the Ethereum community because it's a genuinely novel primitive. Learning from the professor who invented it ensures accuracy and depth.

LOGICAL FLOW: After MEV/OEV, explore novel protocol designs that extend Ethereum's security model.

Lightning Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution that enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin payments through payment channels. Taproot (2021 upgrade) improved Bitcoin's scripting capabilities, privacy, and efficiency. Schnorr signatures enable signature aggregation and multi-signature improvements. These are protocol-level upgrades that extend Bitcoin's capabilities—advanced topics.

WHAT THE LISTENER WILL LEARN:
- How the Lightning Network works (payment channels, routing, HTLC contracts)
- What Taproot is and how it improves Bitcoin (MAST, Schnorr signatures)
- How Schnorr signatures enable signature aggregation (smaller, more private transactions)
- Multi-signature improvements (more efficient multisig)
- How Lightning enables instant Bitcoin payments (solving the 10-minute block time limitation)
- Bitcoin's Layer 2 scaling approach vs. Ethereum's rollups

WHY THIS GUEST/EPISODE IS CREDIBLE:
Andreas Antonopoulos is the world's most respected Bitcoin educator—his "Mastering Bitcoin" book is the definitive technical guide. Here, he discusses advanced protocol features with Anita Posch, another respected Bitcoin educator. This episode brings beginner learners full-circle: they started with Andreas explaining Bitcoin basics; they end with Andreas explaining cutting-edge Bitcoin upgrades. The progression demonstrates how much they've learned.

LOGICAL FLOW: Final episode returns to Bitcoin with advanced protocol upgrades, completing the journey from Bitcoin basics (Episode 1) to advanced Bitcoin technology (Episode 18).
