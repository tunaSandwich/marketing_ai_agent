    "description": "Understand how cryptocurrency and blockchain technology actually work—from Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus to Ethereum's smart contracts to zero-knowledge proofs enabling privacy and scaling. This course demystifies crypto through expert interviews with the people who built these systems: protocol founders like Vitalik Buterin and Andreas Antonopoulos, core developers like Tim Beiko coordinating Ethereum upgrades, academic cryptographers like Professor Bill Buchanan OBE, and researchers like Eli Ben-Sasson who invented zkSTARKs.\n\nBeginning with foundational concepts, you'll learn what Bitcoin is from Andreas Antonopoulos (author of \"Mastering Bitcoin\"), how Ethereum enables programmable money from its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and the cryptographic primitives that secure blockchains from university professors. You'll understand proof-of-work mining, why decentralization matters philosophically, and how DeFi protocols create financial primitives without intermediaries.\n\nThe intermediate level dives into how these systems actually work: Ethereum's technical roadmap (The Merge to proof-of-stake, Layer 2 rollups), how core developers coordinate protocol upgrades, the oracle problem in smart contracts, and the economics of Bitcoin mining. You'll learn from Ethereum Foundation developers, protocol builders, and legal-tech experts who bridge code and law.\n\nFinally, you'll explore cutting-edge research: zero-knowledge proofs from the professor who invented zkSTARKs, MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) from the Flashbots team tackling Ethereum's \"invisible tax,\" Oracle Extractable Value as the next MEV frontier, and advanced Bitcoin Layer 2 scaling via Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades. This isn't crypto hype—it's crypto technology, explained by the researchers and builders pushing the boundaries of decentralized systems.",
