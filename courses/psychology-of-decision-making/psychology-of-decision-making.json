    "description": "Master the science of better decision-making through this expertly curated journey featuring Nobel Prize winners, world-renowned psychologists, and pioneering behavioral economists. You'll learn directly from the researchers who discovered how our minds actually work—from Daniel Kahneman's revolutionary System 1 vs. System 2 framework to Richard Thaler's groundbreaking work on nudges and choice architecture. This course transforms abstract research into practical wisdom, showing you exactly why we make predictable mistakes and how to correct them.\n\nYour expert guides include two Nobel laureates (Kahneman and Thaler), a MacArthur \"Genius\" Fellow (Angela Duckworth), Harvard and Princeton professors, and thought leaders like Dan Ariely, Annie Duke, and Julia Galef who've dedicated their careers to understanding judgment and rationality. You'll hear from the pioneer of neuroeconomics (Paul Glimcher) on how the brain computes value, from Philip Tetlock on his landmark forecasting research that outperformed intelligence agencies, and from Cass Sunstein on his work advising governments worldwide. These aren't self-help gurus—they're the scientists who fundamentally changed how we understand human cognition.\n\nThe course progresses strategically from accessible foundations to cutting-edge research frontiers. Beginner episodes introduce core concepts through engaging conversations on top-tier podcasts, making revolutionary insights feel intuitive. Intermediate episodes dive deeper into mechanisms and applications—how biases manifest in modern life, why good decisions can have bad outcomes, and the fascinating history of behavioral economics. Advanced episodes explore the neural basis of decision-making, sophisticated forecasting techniques, and metacognitive strategies for thinking about your own thinking.\n\nBy completion, you'll understand not just what cognitive biases are, but why they exist, how they operate at neural and psychological levels, and most importantly, evidence-based strategies for making smarter choices. From everyday decisions to high-stakes professional judgment, from recognizing when to trust intuition to knowing when careful analysis is essential, this course provides a comprehensive education in the psychology of human judgment—taught by the world's leading experts in the field.",
