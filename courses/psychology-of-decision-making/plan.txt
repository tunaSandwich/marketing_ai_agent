# Psychology of Decision Making - Course Plan

## Course Purpose
Create a comprehensive learning path on decision-making psychology, covering cognitive biases, heuristics, intuition vs. rational thinking, and evidence-based strategies for making smarter choices. The course will feature world-class behavioral economists, psychologists, and neuroscientists being interviewed about their research and insights.

## Learning Objectives

### Beginner Level (Foundational Concepts)
- Understand System 1 (fast, intuitive) vs System 2 (slow, analytical) thinking
- Learn core cognitive biases: anchoring, availability heuristic, confirmation bias, recency bias
- Understand loss aversion and why we fear losses more than we value gains
- Explore common decision-making traps in everyday life
- Learn basic heuristics (mental shortcuts) and when they help vs. hurt

**Target episodes:** Accessible interviews with top experts on popular podcasts (Lex Fridman, Huberman Lab, Tim Ferriss interviewing Kahneman, Ariely, Thaler, etc.)

### Intermediate Level (Mechanisms & Applications)
- Deep dive into prospect theory and how we evaluate risk
- Understand framing effects and how presentation changes decisions
- Learn about choice architecture and nudges
- Explore mental accounting and sunk cost fallacy
- Understand social proof, defaults, and environmental influences on choices
- Learn practical applications in business, health, and personal life

**Target episodes:** Subject-specific podcasts (Hidden Brain, Freakonomics, Choiceology) interviewing domain experts and practitioners

### Advanced Level (Research Frontiers & Neuroscience)
- Explore neuroeconomics: brain mechanisms behind decision-making
- Understand bounded rationality and ecological rationality
- Learn about predictive processing and Bayesian brain theories
- Explore group decision-making and collective intelligence
- Understand AI decision-making vs. human judgment
- Examine philosophical questions: free will, determinism, and responsibility

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All 18 episodes feature identifiable expert guests with credentials documented
- [ ] Each episode has specific expertise signals (job title, affiliation, research area)
- [ ] All episodes are interview format (not solo monologues)
- [ ] All 18 podcasts are different (maximum diversity)
- [ ] No life coaches or self-help gurus without research background
- [ ] No spiritual/mystical interpretations of cognitive science
- [ ] Prioritized Top 200 podcasts or recognized behavioral science shows
- [ ] Beginner episodes are accessible (famous hosts interviewing top experts)
- [ ] Intermediate episodes go deeper into mechanisms and applications
- [ ] Advanced episodes feature cutting-edge research and neuroscience
- [ ] Logical progression within each level
- [ ] Course description emphasizes scientific rigor and expert credentials
- [ ] Broad panel of different experts (not same guest repeated)

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Generic "life coach" or "success coach" without research credentials
- Podcasts mixing decision science with manifestation/law of attraction
- Episodes explaining Wikipedia articles without expert guests
- Casual conversations between non-experts
- Business podcasts covering topic superficially
- Amateur podcasts with low production quality
- Episodes where decision-making is tangential, not central

## Expected Outcome
A world-class course featuring interviews with Nobel Prize winners, Ivy League professors, and leading researchers in behavioral economics, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. Listeners will progress from understanding basic biases to advanced decision neuroscience, learning from the scientists who discovered these principles.
