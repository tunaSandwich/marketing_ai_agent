## REJECTED EPISODES

### ❌ REJECT - Most "Lex Fridman" search results
**Reason:** Results were ABOUT Lex Fridman as guest on other shows, not him HOSTING decision-making experts. Would need to search for specific Lex Fridman podcast episodes with experts like Kahneman or Ariely.

### ❌ REJECT - Most "Huberman Lab" search results
**Reason:** Top results were about the podcast, not specific episodes. Would need to find specific Huberman Lab episodes where he interviews decision-making experts or discusses the topic himself with credentials.

### ❌ REJECT - Generic "Cognitive Bias" episodes without clear expert
**Reason:** Many results lacked identifiable expert guests with credentials. Need clear expertise signals.

### ❌ REJECT - Book summary podcasts without author interview
**Reason:** While useful, prefer episodes with actual experts rather than summaries by non-experts.
