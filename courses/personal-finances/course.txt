## COURSE DESCRIPTION (FOR JSON FILE)

This comprehensive Personal Finances course takes you from financial novice to sophisticated investor through 18 carefully curated expert interviews. Every episode features credentialed professionals—Certified Financial Planners (CFP®), Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA), CPAs, behavioral economists, Stanford-educated attorneys, and CEOs of major financial institutions—ensuring you learn from legitimate authorities, not casual opinions.

**Beginner Level** builds your foundation through money psychology, decision-making science, and practical basics. You'll learn from a CPA (Mel Abraham) who breaks down investing fundamentals, a CFP® with therapy training (Elizabeth Snyder) who addresses emotional money barriers, an international bestselling author (Bodo Schäfer) who reshapes money beliefs, and a Texas A&M professor (Melina Palmer) who explains how your brain makes financial decisions.

**Intermediate Level** deepens your investment knowledge with institutional perspectives. Learn from the CEO of Markel Group (Tom Gayner) who studied under Charlie Munger, a rare CFP®/CFA® dual-credential advisor (Jeremy Keil—one of only 6 in his state), Morningstar's former Director of Equity Research (Pat Dorsey) on competitive advantage analysis, and professional portfolio managers from asset management firms.

**Advanced Level** covers cutting-edge topics: market structure from Simplify Asset Management's Chief Strategist (Michael Green, CFA), behavioral finance from Orion's Chief Behavioral Officer (Daniel Crosby), FIRE strategies from a CFP® specialist (Cody Garrett), estate planning from a Stanford Law graduate (Diedre Braverman), investment themes from Strategas' Chief Investment Strategist (Jason Trennert), and behavioral economics at scale from the UK Financial Conduct Authority (Steven Human).

All 18 episodes come from different podcasts, creating maximum diversity of voices and perspectives. The course progression is intentional: master money psychology before tactics, understand investment principles before products, and optimize systematically at advanced levels. By the end, you'll have the knowledge framework of a sophisticated investor, taught by the same experts who advise Fortune 500 executives, manage billions in assets, and shape financial policy.
