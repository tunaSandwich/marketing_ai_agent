# Personal Finances Course Strategy Plan

## Course Purpose

Create a comprehensive learning path on Personal Finances — helping listeners gain clarity and control over saving, investing, and managing money. The course will progress from foundational money management principles through intermediate investment strategies to advanced financial planning and optimization.

Each course:
- Focuses on Personal Finances (saving, investing, budgeting, retirement, tax strategy, wealth building)
- Is divided into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced
- Episodes must come from 18 different podcasts, ordered intentionally for progressive learning
- **CRITICAL: Episodes must be expert interviews, not solo host monologues**
- Tone: practical, educational, empowering — the listener should feel equipped to take control of their financial future
