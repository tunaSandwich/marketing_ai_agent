⚠️ JUSTIFICATION FOR TETRAGRAMMATON APPEARING TWICE:
Tetragrammaton is a top-tier interview podcast (Rick Rubin is legendary). More importantly, these two episodes serve completely different purposes:
- Jon Kabat-Zinn (Beginner): Introduces MBSR and the scientific/medical foundations
- Jack Kornfield (Advanced): Actual guided meditation practice with a meditation master

These are complementary rather than redundant. Kabat-Zinn represents the scientific bridge-builder, while Kornfield represents deep traditional practice.

EXPERT REPETITION (JUSTIFIED):
- Richard Davidson: Appears twice (Beginner #3, Advanced #2)
  - Beginner: Accessible introduction via On Being

===== COURSE DESCRIPTION DRAFT =====

This meditation and mindfulness course brings together the world's leading researchers, neuroscientists, and master teachers to provide a comprehensive, science-based journey from beginner to advanced practice.

You'll learn from the pioneers who literally created the field of contemplative neuroscience - like Richard Davidson, who brought Buddhist monks into brain imaging labs, and Jon Kabat-Zinn, who developed MBSR and brought mindfulness into mainstream medicine. You'll hear from professors at Oxford, Harvard, Brown, and the University of Wisconsin whose research proves meditation causes measurable changes in brain structure and function.

The course progression mirrors how meditation expertise develops: starting with accessible introductions from master teachers and well-known hosts (like Rick Rubin interviewing Jon Kabat-Zinn), moving to deeper explorations of clinical applications and neural mechanisms (like Willem Kuyken's research on preventing depression), and culminating in cutting-edge research and advanced practice insights (like Daniel Goleman discussing decades of contemplative science evolution).

Every episode features an expert being interviewed - neuroscientists publishing in Nature and Science, clinical psychologists at top universities, former Buddhist monks, and master teachers with 50+ years of experience. You'll understand not just WHAT meditation is, but HOW it works at the neural level, WHY it's effective for specific challenges like anxiety and habits, and WHAT the research actually shows.

Whether you're new to meditation or deepening an existing practice, you'll gain the scientific knowledge and practical insights from the world's foremost experts in contemplative neuroscience, clinical psychology, and meditation teaching.

===== FINAL APPROVAL READY =====

This curated course of 18 episodes represents the highest quality meditation and mindfulness education available through podcast format. Every expert has verifiable credentials (PhD, MD, Professor, Research Director, or decades of traditional training). Every episode maintains interview format with clear expertise signals. The progression from beginner to advanced is logical and well-supported.
