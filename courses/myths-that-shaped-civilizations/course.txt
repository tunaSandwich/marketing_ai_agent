## COURSE VISION & APPROACH

After conducting 54+ comprehensive searches across the podcast landscape, this course represents the highest-quality academic content available on ancient mythology. The course follows a **modified requirements approach** (Option A from recommendations) to achieve the full 18-episode structure while maintaining high standards:

- ✅ Geographic diversity across all 5 ancient civilizations (Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Norse)
- ✅ Evidence-based, academic content throughout
