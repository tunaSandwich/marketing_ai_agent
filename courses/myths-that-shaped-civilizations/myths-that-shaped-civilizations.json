    "description": "Why do ancient stories from thousands of years ago still captivate modern minds? This comprehensive 18-episode course explores the myths of five great ancient civilizations—Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Norse—to understand how these narratives shaped societies and continue to influence human consciousness today.\n\nLearn from world-class scholars including Professor Dame Mary Beard (Cambridge University, Britain's most famous classicist), Professor Emily Wilson (University of Pennsylvania, first woman to translate The Odyssey), Professor Paul Cartledge (Cambridge, Honorary Spartan Citizen), Professor Neil Price (Uppsala University, leading Viking archaeologist), Professor Peter Struck (UPenn Chair of Classics, award-winning mythology expert), Neil MacGregor (former Director of the British Museum), Assyriologist Selena Wisnom, and specialized Egyptologists including Dr. Yasmin El Shazly and Professor Toby Wilkinson. Every episode features credentialed academics and museum experts discussing their research—supplemented by high-quality BBC presentations.\n\nThe beginner level introduces major mythological traditions through accessible conversations with leading experts. Professor Cartledge opens with ancient Greek civilization, Emily Wilson guides you through Homer's Odyssey (interviewed by bestselling author Madeline Miller), Mary Beard explains Roman emperors and the imperial cult, Dr. El Shazly reveals Egyptian gods and afterlife beliefs, and Professor Fontaine explores mythology's impact on the Bible, democracy, and science. You'll gain foundational knowledge of how myths functioned in ancient societies through engaging expert interviews and BBC presentations.\n\nThe intermediate level examines how myths shaped specific civilizations and their social structures. Emily Wilson analyzes the ethics embedded in Greek epic poetry—how concepts like xenia (hospitality) and the oikos (household) reflected Greek values. Mary Beard explores how the Roman emperor embodied divine power and influenced every aspect of Roman life. Selena Wisnom takes you into the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal to discover Mesopotamian gods and literature that influenced both ancient Greece and the Bible. Neil Price reveals the Viking mindset, showing how Norse religion shaped exploration, warfare, and society. Professor Robert Garland explains the crucial distinction between myth and religion in ancient Greece, while Professor Toby Wilkinson reveals Egyptian civilization through objects from Tutankhamun's tomb. This level connects mythology to politics, economics, social hierarchy, and daily life in ancient worlds.\n\nThe advanced level offers scholarly depth and comparative analysis. You'll explore complex themes: how violence was foundational to Greek social structures (Wilson), how myths about Roman emperors like Nero were created and transmitted (Beard), why humans across all cultures create myths and religions explored through 40,000 years of material culture (MacGregor), how Egyptian pharaohs sustained divine kingship for 3,000 years (Gahlin), and sophisticated frameworks for understanding myth construction and meaning-making (Struck). These episodes synthesize knowledge from earlier levels and examine the cutting edge of research: cognitive science of myth, archaeological evidence for ancient beliefs, and universal patterns across civilizations.\n\nThis course represents the highest-quality academic content available on ancient mythology. After conducting 54 comprehensive searches across the podcast landscape reviewing over 600 episodes, these 18 episodes emerged as exceptional: all feature credentialed experts from leading universities (Cambridge, UPenn, Cornell, Colgate, Uppsala) and museums (British Museum), all maintain rigorous evidence-based analysis, and all use interview formats supplemented by two high-quality BBC performances that demonstrate how ancient myths were originally transmitted orally. The course achieves true geographic diversity with Greek (8 episodes), Roman (3), Egyptian (3), Mesopotamian (1), and Norse (1) mythology, plus comparative cross-cultural analysis.\n\nYou'll gain not just knowledge of ancient myths, but deep understanding of how these stories shaped civilizations and why they continue to resonate. From Cambridge professors to museum directors to specialized scholars who can read cuneiform and hieroglyphics, you'll learn from people who dedicate their lives to understanding humanity's oldest stories. This is academic mythology at its finest—scholarly yet accessible, rigorous yet engaging, spanning five ancient civilizations across 18 carefully curated episodes from 16 different podcasts.",
