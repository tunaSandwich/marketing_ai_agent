After 38+ searches, the overwhelming majority of results are:
- ❌ Storytelling/narrative podcasts (reading myths aloud)

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Compile detailed list of ALL promising episodes with full descriptions
2. ⏳ Evaluate each promising episode against quality criteria
3. ⏳ Determine if sufficient quality episodes exist for full 18-episode course
4. ⏳ Consider alternative strategies if gaps exist:
   - Relax "different podcasts" requirement slightly
   - Include high-quality BBC/academic presentations (e.g., Natalie Haynes)
   - Expand search to include ancient history podcasts discussing mythology contextually
   - Search for specific academic names from plan (Emily Wilson, Edith Hall, etc.)
