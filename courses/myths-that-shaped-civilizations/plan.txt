# MYTHS THAT SHAPED CIVILIZATIONS - COURSE PLAN
## Why Ancient Stories Still Rule Modern Minds

Date: November 2024
Course Slug: myths-that-shaped-civilizations

---

## COURSE VISION

This course explores ancient mythology from diverse civilizations around the world—Greek, Roman, Norse, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and others—to understand how these stories shaped their societies and why they continue to resonate in modern consciousness.

The focus is on ANCIENT myths only, examining the original stories, their cultural contexts, and their lasting influence on human thought. We will NOT cover modern mythmaking or political myths, but rather focus on understanding the ancient narratives that formed the foundation of civilization.

**Key Question**: Why do these ancient stories, created thousands of years ago, still captivate and influence modern minds?

## NOTES

- Geographic diversity is crucial: Don't just focus on Greek/Roman myths
- Look for Egyptologists for Egyptian content, not general historians
- Norse mythology episodes should feature Viking specialists or Norse historians
- Mesopotamian content is rarer - may need to search "Gilgamesh", "Sumerian", "Babylonian", "Assyriologist"
- Prefer episodes that discuss both the myths AND their cultural significance
- Archaeological podcasts might have excellent content about ancient religion/mythology
- Museum podcasts (British Museum, Met, etc.) often have expert curators discussing artifacts and myths
- If struggling to find content for a specific civilization, try searching for that civilization generally (e.g., "ancient Egypt") and check if episode discusses mythology
- Quality over speed: Better to conduct 35 searches and find gems than rush with 25
