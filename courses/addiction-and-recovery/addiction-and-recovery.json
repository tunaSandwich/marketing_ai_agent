    "description": "Understand addiction through the lens of neuroscience and evidence-based medicine with leading researchers, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists from Stanford, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, and other top institutions. This course treats addiction as the complex medical condition it is—featuring MD/PhD experts who explain how addiction changes the brain, why it's not a moral failure, and what actually works for treatment and recovery.\n\nBeginning with foundational neuroscience, you'll learn from Stanford's Dr. Anna Lembke (Professor and Chief of Addiction Medicine) about dopamine and the brain's reward system, from Dr. Nora Volkow (Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse) about breakthrough addiction research, from physician Dr. Gabor Maté about the trauma-addiction connection, and from neuroscientist Dr. Marc Lewis who challenges the disease model while explaining actual brain mechanisms. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett (Harvard, top 1% cited scientist) explains how emotions work in the brain, foundational to understanding addictive behaviors, and Dr. Peter Attia discusses brain health and cognitive impacts.\n\nThe intermediate level builds deeper understanding of treatment mechanisms and co-occurring conditions: addiction psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Pham explains PTSD and dual diagnosis, Dr. Roland Engelbrecht covers medication-assisted treatment for alcohol addiction, Dr. Andrew Tatarsky (NYU, past-president of NYS Division on Addiction Psychology) introduces harm reduction psychotherapy, and neuroscientists explain memory formation (Dr. Charan Ranganath, UC Davis) and predictive processing (Dr. Anil Seth, Sussex) as they relate to cravings and compulsive behavior.\n\nFinally, you'll explore cutting-edge research and policy: Dr. Albert Garcia-Romeu (Johns Hopkins) discusses clinical trials of psilocybin for addiction treatment, Dr. Carl Hart (Columbia Professor) challenges conventional thinking about drugs with rigorous neuroscience, Dr. Robert Malenka (Stanford Professor, Wu Tsai Institute) provides comprehensive neuropharmacology across multiple drug classes, the Camden Opioid Research Initiative team explains genetics and personalized addiction medicine, and journalist Maia Szalavitz with Dr. Leana Wen discuss harm reduction as public health policy. By the end, you'll understand both the brain science of addiction and the evidence-based approaches that actually help people recover.",
