# Addiction and Recovery Course - Comprehensive Plan

## Course Vision

Create a science-based addiction course that treats addiction as the complex medical condition it is, featuring:
- Neuroscientists explaining brain mechanisms
- Addiction psychiatrists and MDs discussing treatment
- Researchers presenting evidence-based approaches
- Zero spiritual/mystical content
- Interview format only (no host monologues)

## Course Structure & Learning Goals

- Withdrawal and detox neurobiology
- Psychological interventions that work (CBT, DBT, etc.)
- Social neuroscience of recovery (community, support)

**Ideal format**: Topic-specific podcasts or medical podcasts featuring practicing addiction specialists

**Target guests**: Clinical researchers, practicing addiction psychiatrists, neuroscientists studying specific mechanisms

### Advanced Level (6 episodes)
**Goal**: Current research frontiers and cutting-edge approaches

Topics to cover:
- Genetic markers and personalized addiction medicine
- Novel therapeutic approaches (psychedelics for addiction, brain stimulation)
- Epigenetics and addiction vulnerability
- Treatment policy debates grounded in research
- Long-term recovery neurobiology (brain healing over time)
- Research gaps and future directions
- Harm reduction vs abstinence (evidence-based analysis)

**Ideal format**: Academic podcasts, research-focused discussions, expert-to-expert conversations
